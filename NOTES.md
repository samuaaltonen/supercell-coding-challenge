Ideas:
- Spawn multiple balls with different colors representing different velocities. Different colors grant extra points.
- Balls have mass that affect other balls like gravity so it is possible to do trick shots where faster more straight going ball affects more slower ball
- Balls have collisions
- Colorful particle effects

Workflow:
- Noticed a bug where players paddle always goes down. Also wanted to make it players paddle doesnt automatically move for better control.
